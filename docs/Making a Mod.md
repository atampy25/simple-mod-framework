Creating a mod with the framework is very simple - just add a manifest file and put your mod files in a folder. More advanced framework features that can make modding much easier can be found in the various other documentation files.

## Setting up

First, if you haven't already, you should enable developer mode. In theory, since you're looking at the documentation, you should already have developer mode enabled - the in-app viewer is the preferred way to access the framework's documentation. If you're looking at this through GitHub or by manually opening the Info folder, you can enable developer mode and gain a documentation viewer as well as a few other things by going to the Info page and clicking "Enable developer mode".

Once that's sorted, you should also install some kind of editor - using Notepad to edit code/configuration files is torture. Visual Studio Code is recommended; it has a lot of useful features available right out of the box, like auto-formatting, syntax highlighting, telling you where errors are and allowing for autocomplete/in-editor documentation/meaningful errors using the schema. Notepad++ is a popular editor, but it's only slightly better than Notepad (which would be assumed from the name) and is without a doubt worse than VS Code for editing SMF mods.

### Recommended: the GitHub template

If you plan on updating your mod after its release, or you'd like the ability to quickly set up a new mod, or you'd like to collaborate with others, or you'd like to track your changes for easy debugging, there's a GitHub template for mods that handles everything for you - it'll automatically increment the version and generate changelogs, among other things.

The only prerequisite is knowledge of Git/GitHub, which is generally something you should have when you're working with mods anyway.

You can find the template at `https://github.com/atampy25/smf-mod`. Follow the instructions in the README, cloning the mod repository as a sub-directory of your Mods folder.

### Manually setting up a mod folder

If you want to make an incredibly simple mod that you will never update again, or you don't have knowledge of Git and don't want to spend the half an hour required to learn it, you can manually set up a mod folder.

Create a new folder in the `Mods` folder where you have put the framework. Call it whatever you like.

Then, put a file called `manifest.json` in it. Paste the following into it:

```jsonc
{
	// This $schema key isn't *necessary*, but having it will allow you to automatically
	// see all the available options in VS Code and see documentation for them just by
	// hovering, so you don't need to refer to the Manifest page too often.
	"$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atampy25/simple-mod-framework/main/Mod%20Manager/src/lib/manifest-schema.json",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "id": "YourNameOrUserName.FirstMod",
  "name": "Your First Mod",
  "description": "Extremely good description",
  "authors": ["YourNameOrUserName"],
  "contentFolders": ["content"],
  "frameworkVersion": "2.30.3"
}
```

Most of those fields are self-explanatory. There are other optional fields documented in, as well as more explanation of these ones in, [Manifest](Manifest.md).

Notice how `contentFolders` has been set to `["content"]`. This is the name of the folder where most of your mod's files will be. Create a folder called `content` (or change the value of `contentFolders` to whatever you want and name a new folder that).

## Adding some content

The content folder contains other folders named after the game's chunks (chunk0, chunk1... chunk28). Create folders for whichever chunks your mod edits content in.

Now, just place your mod's files in those chunk folders. Files in chunk0 for example will go in the `chunk0` folder. There are other types of files that the framework can automatically convert between as well, like textures and entities. Those are documented in [Special File Types](<Special File Types.md>).

## That's it lmao

All a framework mod needs is a manifest and some content. In fact, if you only use manifest features, you don't even need any content folders!
