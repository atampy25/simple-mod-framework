# simple-mod-framework
A mod framework for HITMAN 3 that allows the automatic synthesis of mods from source files.

You can download an artifact (nightly) version of the framework from [here](https://nightly.link/atampy25/simple-mod-framework/workflows/artifact/main/Output.zip). This is a development version with huge changes from the current release, so some things may not work properly, and everything is subject to change.
